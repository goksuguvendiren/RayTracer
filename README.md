# Basic Ray Tracer

My raytracer that started as a course project, hopefully will evolve into a path tracer. 

*Features implemented:*

* Whitted ray tracer
* Bounding volume hierarchy
* CPU parallelization
* Point lights
* Lens camera model - Depth of Field
* Diffuse (matte), specular (reflective) and refractive materials
* Texture mapping

This project is almost finalized, the path tracer that evolves out of this is in another repo :)

Some results :
